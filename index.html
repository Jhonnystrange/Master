        <div id="para"> There are billions of nerve cells (neurons) in our brains that play vital roles in our body’s ability to function and communicate. These cells get energy from our food, in turn helping our bodies and minds to operate smoothly. Not getting the proper nutrients can lead to brain processing problems and may result in abnormal moods, thinking, perception, or behavior. <br>
            A deficit of nutrients on either side of the brain can be caused by food sensitivities or inadequate diets and can result in cognitive dysfunction, most often in the right hemisphere of our brains. <br> <br></div>

        <h1>Meatball Sub:</h1> 
        <img src="images/image3.jpg"; width="800px" height="400px"/>
        <p class="para1">Any good hoagie roll works well for these subs. I like to use a high-quality sesame seed hoagie. I wouldn recommend a hot dog bun as they can be too flimsy and will likely fall apart under the weight of the meatballs and sauce. Most grocery stores will have some sort of hoagie rolls in their bakery section. If you are lucky enough to live near an Italian-style bakery, they will almost certainly have a roll that works well for meatball subs.</p>

        <h2 class="ing">Ingredients :</h2> 
        <ul>
<li>1/3 cup whole milk, warmed</li>
<li>1 slice white bread, crumbled</li>
<li>1 pound ground beef (80 to 85% lean)</li>
<li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1/2 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 cup Italian breadcrumbs, for coating</li>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil, for searing</li>
</ul>

<h1>Method:</h1>
<h4>1. Prepare the meatball mixture:</h4>
<p>Add the warm milk to a large bowl with the crumbled bread and let soak for a minute or two.  Then add the ground beef, Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, salt, and oregano. Mix with your hands until combined; its okay if there are a few bread chunks still.</p>
<h4>2. Shape the meatballs:</h4>
<p>Using wet hands, shape the mixture into about 16 even meatballs—each should be around 1 ounce, or 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Coat each meatball in breadcrumbs and set it on a baking sheet while you shape the rest of the meatballs.</p>
<h4>4. Simmer the meatballs:</h4>
<p>Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add up to 1 cup of water to the pot if the marinara sauce seems too thick. Once the sauce is simmering, turn the heat down to low and cover with the lid, leaving it ajar so some steam can escape. Simmer until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. </p>
<h4>5. Assemble and bake the meatball subs:</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 450˚F. 

Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Using a bread knife, slice the hoagie rolls down the center, leaving the two sides attached, and open them up like a book. Add a little butter or drizzle of oil to the skillet and add the rolls cut side down. Cook until the hoagies are toasted, about 2 minutes. You will likely need to toast them 1 or 2 at a time, depending on the size of your skillet.

Scoop 4 meatballs out of the marinara sauce and chop them in half. Add them to a toasted hoagie and spoon about 1/2 cup of sauce over the top of the meatballs. Top with 2 slices of provolone. Repeat with the remaining rolls and meatballs.

Bake the hoagies until the cheese is well melted, about 5 minutes. Top with basil and banana peppers, if desired. Serve immediately.</p>
